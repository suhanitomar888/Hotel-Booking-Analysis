💡✨ Deep Dive: Hotel Bookings SQL Analysis Project

I recently completed a comprehensive SQL project analysing hotel reservation data to uncover valuable business insights for the hospitality industry. 🏨📈

🔍 What I analysed:

1.Total number of reservations

2.Most popular meal plan

3.Average room price for bookings with children

4.Year-wise reservation counts

5.Most commonly booked room types

6.Weekend booking trends

7.Maximum and minimum lead times

8.Most common market segment type

9.Total confirmed bookings

10.Total number of adults and children

11.Ranking room types by average price within each market segment

12.Top 2 most booked room types per market segment

13.Average number of nights spent by guests for each room type

14.Most common room type and average price for bookings with children

15.Market segment with highest average price per room

✨ Key skills practiced:
✔️ Complex SQL querying
✔️ Window functions (RANK, PARTITION BY)
✔️ Business-oriented analytical thinking
✔️ Data-driven decision support

💭 Impact: This analysis demonstrates how structured data can guide pricing, marketing, and operational decisions to enhance guest experience and optimize revenue.

I’m excited to continue building such data-driven solutions for real-world business problems.
